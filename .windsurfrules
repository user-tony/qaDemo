# Project Guidelines for AI Development

1. Feature Protection Rules:
   - DO NOT remove or modify existing features without explicit approval
   - Document any feature changes in /docs/changes.md
   - If a feature needs updates, first create a proposal in /proposals
   - Keep backwards compatibility when possible

2. Development Framework Guidelines:
   - Prioritize using existing frameworks and libraries
   - Current approved frameworks:
     * Next.js 14+ (primary framework)
     * React 18+ (UI library)
     * Tailwind CSS (styling)
   - New framework additions require team review

3. Code Quality Requirements:
   - All features must be fully functional before merge
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Test across different browsers

4. Component Structure Guidelines:
   - Keep AI-related components in /components/ai directory
   - Follow atomic design pattern
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Add TypeScript types for all props

5. Don't modify these core files:
   - /app/api/ai/*
   - /lib/ai-utils/*
   - /config/ai-config.ts
   - Any existing feature files without approval

6. Development Process:
   - Create feature branch for new development
   - Write tests before implementing features
   - Get code review before merging
   - Update documentation alongside code

7. Testing Requirements:
   - Must have unit tests (Jest)
   - E2E tests for critical paths (Cypress)
   - Test coverage > 80%
   - Include accessibility tests

8. Performance Guidelines:
   - Optimize AI model loading
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Regular performance audits
   - Monitor and optimize bundle size

9. Completion Criteria:
   - Features must be fully functional
   - All tests must pass
   - Documentation must be complete
   - No breaking changes to existing features
   - Mobile responsive design
   - Browser compatibility checked
   - Performance requirements met

10. Framework Extension:
    - Evaluate existing solutions first
    - Document why new framework is needed
    - Consider impact on bundle size
    - Ensure team has necessary expertise
    - Provide migration guide if needed
